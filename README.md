# Sandbox

Sandbox-style roleplaying massive online game with indirect character control and world simulation. Currently in 2d with multiple z-levels (like in dwarf fortress).

Runs both on clientside and server. 

# What's done

1) Basic data system
2) Map walking
3) Spiral searches and pathfinding
4) Basic fractal map

# Planned features

1) Behavior simulation
2) Economy simulation
3) City cimulation
4) Procedurally generated world
5) 520x520km world with full persistense
6) Fractal map with level of detail.
7) Tree growing and renewable resources
8) Quest generation

# Can I help?

Yes, please.

The game's going to be big, so there're multiple things that could be done separately from current development:

1) GPU generated world. Like in this example: glsl.heroku.com/e#10449.0, bit without all the ray-casting.

2) Graphics, visuals, sprites. Out of scope for us now, but contributions are welcome.

3) Custom storage in C to persist collections of 64bit numbers, index and make very simple queries. We have parts of that working in js, but apparently they will not be enough

4) Anything else from the list of planned features. Contact me if you're not sure so we can figure out something useful and fun.
